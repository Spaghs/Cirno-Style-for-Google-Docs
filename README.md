# Cirno Style for Google Docs
This should be used with Stylus extension. Instead of copying or cloning the repository, you can easily find and download "Cirno for docs" in [UserStyles World](https://userstyles.world/style/17957/cirno-for-docs). Even with this name, Cirno is only the default configuration. Instead of searching the best style to match google docs CSS, you can easily configure many things (colors, light/dark theme, wallpaper, some adjustments...) in the stylus configuration tab.
